Difference Between Library and API

Library
1. A library is a collection of functions / objects that serves one 
particular purpose.
2. Library is Reusable set of code or compilation of set of things which 
you may need in order to  ease your process of development.
3. ex: JQuery library, is a library of prewritten, cross-browser 
Javascript animations and functions which you will need while making a 
website.
4. In other words, A Library is a chunk of code that you can call from 
your own code, to help you do things more quickly/easily. 
5. For example, a Bitmap Processing library will provide facilities for 
loading and manipulating bitmap images, saving you having to write all 
that code for yourself. A  library performs specific, well-defined 
operations.


API
1.	An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your 
program or library  without having direct access.
2.	There will be back-end code to support the front-end code which 
needs to be accessible to programmers for Custom Software Development.
3.	Now how do a programmer access this front-end code? Yeah, the 
API – the Interface to Library.
4.	An API (Application Programming Interface) are the 
functions/methods (the front-end code) in a library that you can call to 
ask it to do things for you.
5.	In the context of Android Development:
      •	IDE: JetBrains IntelliJ
      •	Library: android.app.Activity library (Class with all code)
      •	API: Android API to interact with hardware, like the front 
camera of an Android-based device. If your app needs to vibrate the 
phone, you must use the Android API method like vibratePhone()
      •	SDK: The Android Studio (additional tools like DDMS, Emulator, 
ADB, etc.)
